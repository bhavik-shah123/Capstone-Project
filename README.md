# Study of Phishing Attacks and Detection of Spoofing Websites using Machine Learning

This repository contains the repository as well as the code of the projects made during my Capstone research project in the final 4th year at VIT-AP pursuing Computer Science Spec. In Networks and Security. 
Basically, the idea was to study different types of phishing attacks with real-time examples as well as perform a demonstration on how phishing attacks occur which is demonstrated here by a program made using "Shell Script" and PHP and HTML.
Finally, the main objective was achieved by developing and enhancing how to detect phishing URLs using neural networks with different optimizers and different parameters.
For the machine learning part, [the dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/phishing+websites) was used.
